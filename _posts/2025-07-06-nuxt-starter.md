# Nuxt Starter Project – A Custom Setup for Scalable Web Apps

Nuxt 3 starter that goes beyond the default setup provided by Nuxt. 
This custom starter is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JessySeo9955/nuxt_starter), 
and it's designed for developers looking to kick off projects with a solid foundation.

## What I Built

This Nuxt starter includes:

- **Restructured Nuxt Directory Layout**  
  - Cleaned and modular structure for better scalability and maintainability.
  - Enabled easy configuration for different environments

- **Custom Global Loading Indicator Module**  
  I implemented a global loading indicator as a module. It uses Nuxt's composables (`useLoadingIndicator`) and works seamlessly with router navigation.

- **Unit Testing with Vitest**  
  Preconfigured unit test environment using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for component testing.

- **End-to-End Testing with Playwright**  
  E2E test setup using Cypress to ensure app behavior works across full user flows.


## Why This Matters

In real-world projects, starters often need:
- A reliable loading UX
- Testing from day one
- Organized file structure

This Nuxt starter gives a practical, clean foundation with those in place — great for client projects, SaaS prototypes, or personal tools.

## Todos
- Integrate Storybook 
- Implement Auth Module
- Set Up I18n
